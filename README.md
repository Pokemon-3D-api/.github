# Welcome to the Pokémon 3D API Organization 🎮

We are a community-driven, non-profit initiative providing high-quality, web-optimized 3D Pokémon assets and a robust metadata API for developers and creators.

## 🏛️ Project Ecosystem
Our project is modularized to ensure maximum performance and ease of contribution:

* **[🚀 API Server](https://github.com/Pokemon-3D-api/api-server)** The Node.js engine delivering Pokémon metadata and 3D model URLs via high-performance JSON endpoints.

* **[📦 3D Assets](https://github.com/Pokemon-3D-api/assets)** The central database for optimized `.glb` models (Draco & WebP compressed) spanning Generations 1-9.

* **[🎨 Showcase & Demos](https://github.com/Pokemon-3D-api/showcase)** Interactive Pokedex viewers and code examples demonstrating seamless integration with `<model-viewer>`.
